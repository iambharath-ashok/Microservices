#	Microservices

-	The main objective of the micro-services implementation is to split up the application as separate service for each core  API service functionality and it should be deployed independently on cloud
-	We have used spring boot,spring cloud components, pcf, kubernetes, gitlab, oauth2, Docker, Elk and kafka
-	Spring Cloud integrates the Netflix components in the spring environment in a very nice way using auto configuration and convention over configuration similar to how Spring Boot works


##	Why Micro Services Architecture?

-	We chose micro services architecture to write each functionality as a separate service for core and API functionality and it helps us to achieve :
	-	the continuous delivery and deployment
	-	greater monitoring capabilities
	-	High availability and scalability
	-	Security with auth server and resource server
	-	Log analysis
	-	load balancing at client side
	-	Well formated contract for clients using swagger
	-	Reactive programing using Spring flux and mono

##	Patterns in Micro services Architecture

![Patterns-in-Microservices-Architecture](https://optisolcdn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Patterns-in-Microservices-Architecture.png)

-------------------------------------

## Micro services Architecture via Netflix Components

-	We have used the Netflix components to accomplish the above micro services architecture patterns.


Operations Component	| Spring, Netflix OSS
------------------------|-------------------------
Service Discovery server	| Netflix Eureka
Edge Server	or API gateway|	Netflix Zuul
Central configuration server	| Spring Cloud Config Server
Dynamic Routing and Load Balancer	| Netflix Ribbon
OAuth 2.0 protected API’s	| Spring Cloud + Spring Security OAuth2
Monitoring	| Netflix Hystrix dashboard and turbine

-------------------------------------

##	Major Components of Netflix


-	Netflix Eureka – Service Discovery Server

	-	Netflix Eureka allows micro services to register themselves at runtime as they appear in the system landscape.
	-	Client can identify the resource location and number of instances and start consuming services
	
-	Netflix Ribbon – Dynamic Routing & Load Balancer

	-	Netflix Ribbon can be used by service consumers to look up available services and its instances at runtime
	-	Ribbon uses the information available in Eureka to locate appropriate service instances
	-	If more than one instance is found, Ribbon will apply load balancing to spread the requests over the available instances
	
	
-	Netflix Zuul – Edge Server

	-	Zuul is (of course) our gatekeeper to the outside world, not allowing any unauthorized external requests pass through
	-	Zulu also provides a well-known entry point to the micro services in the system landscape
	-	Using dynamically allocated ports is convenient to avoid port conflicts and to minimize administration but it makes it of course harder for any given service consumer
	-	Zuul uses Ribbon to look up available services and routes the external request to an appropriate service instance
	
	
##	Spring Boot & Spring Cloud Netflix OSS – Micro Service Architecture

![Micro Service Architecture](https://optisolcdn-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/MSArchitech.png)



##	Micro Services with Spring Boot

-	Spring Boot is a brand new framework from the team at Pivotal, designed to simplify the bootstrapping and development of a new spring application
-	The framework takes an opinionated approach to configuration, freeing developers from the need to define boilerplate configuration.

##	Spring Cloud Netflix

-	Spring cloud Netflix provides Netflix OSS integrations for spring boot apps through auto configuration and binding to the spring environment and other spring programming models
-	With a few simple annotations we can quickly enable and configure common patterns inside application and to build large distributed systems with Netflix components
-	There are lot of features available with spring cloud Netflix

##	Microservices vs SOA: What's the Difference?


![](https://d1jnx9ba8s6j9r.cloudfront.net/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2-5.png)

-	Monolith:

	-	Monolith is similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged

-	Service-oriented architecture :
	
	-	Is essentially a collection of services. These services communicate with each other
	-	The communication can involve either simple data passing or two or more services coordinating some activity
	-	Some means of connecting services to each other is needed.

-	Microservices, aka microservice architecture
	
	-	is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services modeled around a business domain



##	Microservices vs SOA

-	When comparing microservices to SOA, they both rely on services as the main component, but they vary greatly in terms of service characteristics.
-	Major Differences Between SOA and MSA




SOA	| MSA
----|-----
Follows “share-as-much-as-possible” architecture approach |	Follows “share-as-little-as-possible” architecture approach
Importance is on business functionality reuse	| Importance is on the concept of “bounded context”
They have common governance and standards	| They focus on people, collaboration and freedom of other options
Uses Enterprise Service bus (ESB) for communication	| Simple messaging system
They support multiple message protocols	| They use lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST etc.
Multi-threaded with more overheads to handle I/O	| Single-threaded usually with the use of Event Loop features for non-locking I/O handling
Maximizes application service reusability	| Focuses on decoupling
Traditional Relational Databases are more often used	| Modern Relational Databases are more often used
A systematic change requires modifying the monolith | 	A systematic change is to create a new service
DevOps / Continuous Delivery is becoming popular, but not yet mainstream	| Strong focus on DevOps / Continuous Delivery

##	Microservice Architectures With Spring Cloud and Docker

![](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/1858094-730f2922-ee20-11e5-8df0-e7b51c668847-2.png)

###	Functional Services
	
-	The monolith application was decomposed into three core microservices
-	All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around certain business capabilities
-	I used MongoDB as the primary database for each service. 
-	It also might make sense to have a polyglot persistence architecture (to сhoose the type of database that is best suited to the service requirements)

	
###	Infrastructure Services
	
-	Spring cloud provides powerful tools that enhance Spring Boot applications behaviour to implement those patterns

![](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/1858172-365c0d94-eefa-11e5-90ad-9d74804ca412-2.png)



####	Config Service

-	Spring Cloud Config is horizontally scalable centralized configuration service for distributed systems.
- 	It uses a pluggable repository layer that currently supports local storage, Git, and Subversion. 
-	We can place Config service resources in shared directories - which is shared between all client applications

-	Client-side Usage

	-	Just build Spring Boot application with spring-cloud-starter-config dependency, autoconfiguration will do the res
	-	Now we dont need to define any properties in client applications
	-	All the client application properties can be saved in config server
	-	Just provide bootstrap.yml with the application name and Config service url:
				
				spring:
				  application:
					name: notification-service
				  cloud:
					config:
					  uri: http://config:8888
					  fail-fast: true
		
			
-	With Spring Cloud Config, we Can Change App Configuration Dynamically

	-	EmailService bean was annotated with @RefreshScope
	-	We can the properties without rebuilding and restarting the server
	-	First, change the required properties in the Config server. 
	-	Then, perform the refresh request to the Notification service: curl -H "Authorization: Bearer #token#" -XPOST http://127.0.0.1:8000/notifications/refresh
	
	
-	Notes

	-	There are some limitations for dynamic refreshes though. @RefreshScope doesn't work with @Configuration classes
	-	fail-fast property means that the Spring Boot application will fail startup immediately if it cannot connect to the Config Service. That's very useful when you're starting all applications together
	
	
	


####	Auth Service

-	Authorization responsibilities are completely extracted to separate server, which grants OAuth2 tokens for backend resource services.
-	Auth Server is used for user authorization as well as for secure machine-to-machine communication inside a perimeter.
-	We can retrieve Principal objects from request, check user roles and other stuff with expression-based access control and @PreAuthorize annotation
			
			
			@PreAuthorize("#oauth2.hasScope('server')")
			@RequestMapping(value = "accounts/{name}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
			public List<DataPoint> getStatisticsByAccountName(@PathVariable String name) {
				return statisticsService.findByAccountName(name);
			}

####	API Gateway

-	API Gateway is a single entry point into the system, used to handle requests by routing them to the appropriate backend service or by invoking multiple backend services and aggregating the results
-	Netflix open sourced such an edge service, and now with Spring Cloud we can enable it with one @EnableZuulProxyannotation
-	We use Zuul to store static content (UI application) and to route requests to the appropriate microservices
-	Zuul uses Service discovery mechanism to locate Notification service instances and also Circuit Breaker and Load Balancer
				
				zuul:
				  routes:
					notification-service:
						path: /notifications/**
						serviceId: notification-service
						stripPrefix: false
		
-	That means all requests starting with /notifications will be routed to Notification service
-	There is no hardcoded address, as we can see. Zuul uses Service discovery mechanism to locate Notification service instances		
		
####	Service Discovery

-	It allows automatic detection of network locations for service instances, which could have dynamically assigned addresses because of auto-scaling, failures, and upgrades
-	The key part of service discovery is the registry. 
-	We used Netflix Eureka as the Service Discovery and Registry server
- 	Eureka is a good example of the client-side discovery pattern
	-	when the client is responsible for determining the locations of available service instances (using a registry server) and load balancing requests across them

-	With Spring Boot, you can easily build Eureka Registry with a spring-cloud-starter-eureka-server dependency, @EnableEurekaServer annotation, and simple configuration properties.
-	Client support is enabled with @EnableDiscoveryClient annotation and bootstrap.yml with application name:	

					
						spring:
						  application:
							name: notification-service
							
-	Now, on application startup, it will register with Eureka Server and provide meta-data, such as host and port, health indicator URL, home page, etc. 
-	Eureka receives heartbeat messages from each instance belonging to a service
-	If the heartbeat fails over a configurable timetable, the instance will be removed from the registry.

##	Load Balancer, Circuit Breaker, and Http Client

-	Netflix OSS provides another great set of tools. 

####	Ribbon	

-	Ribbon is a client side load balancer
-	Ribbon makes use of Service Discovery to get details of service locations and available instances
-	Eureka Client provides a dynamic list of available servers so Ribbon could balance between them

####	Hystrix

-	Hystrix is the implementation of a Circuit Breaker pattern, which gives a control over latency and failure from dependencies accessed over the network
-	The main idea is to stop cascading failures in a distributed environment with a large number of microservices
-	Besides circuit breaker control, with Hystrix we can add a fallback method that will be called to obtain a default value in case the main command fails
-	Moreover, Hystrix generates metrics on execution outcomes and latency for each command, that we can use to monitor system behavior

###	Feign

-	Feign is a declarative HTTP client, which seamlessly integrates with Ribbon and Hystrix
-	Actually, with one spring-cloud-starter-feign dependency and @EnableFeignClients annotation we have a full suite of a load balancer, circuit breaker, and HTTP client with a sensible ready-to-go default configuration


			@FeignClient(name = "statistics-service")
			public interface StatisticsServiceClient {
				@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT, value = "/statistics/{accountName}", consumes = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE)
				void updateStatistics(@PathVariable("accountName") String accountName, Account account);
			}



##	Monitor Dashboard via Turbine

-	In this project configuration, each microservice with Hystrix on board pushes metrics to Turbine via Spring Cloud Bus (with AMQP broker)
-	The Monitoring project is just a small Spring boot application with Turbine and Hystrix Dashboard

##	Log Analysis


-	Centralized logging can be very useful when attempting to identify problems in a distributed environment. 
-	Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana stack lets you search and analyze your logs, utilization and network activity data with ease



##	Infrastructure Automation


-	Deploying microservices, with their interdependence, is a much more complex process than deploying a monolith application
-	It is important to have a fully automated infrastructure. We can achieve following benefits with a Continuous Delivery approach:

	-	The ability to release software anytime.
	-	Any build could end up being a release.
	-	Build artifacts once, deploy as needed.
	

-	Here is a simple Continuous Delivery workflow, implemented in this project:



![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6069066/14159789/0dd7a7ce-f6e9-11e5-9fbb-a7fe0f4431e3.png)

-	In this configuration, Travis CI builds tagged images for each successful Git push.
- 	So there is  always a latest image for each microservice on Docker Hub and older images are tagged with Git commit hash
-	It's easy to deploy any of them and quickly roll back, if needed.


##	How to Run All the Things?


-	It's really easy and I suggest you to try. 
-	Keep in mind, that you are going to start 8 Spring Boot applications, 4 MongoDB instances, and RabbitMq
-	Install docker and docker compose 
-	Export environment variables: CONFIG_SERVICE_PASSWORD, NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_PASSWORD, STATISTICS_SERVICE_PASSWORD, ACCOUNT_SERVICE_PASSWORD, MONGODB_PASSWORD


##	Production Mode

-	In this mode, all of the latest images will be pulled from Docker Hub. Just copy docker-compose.yml and hit docker-compose up -d.

		
		docker-compose up -d
		
##	Development Mode


-	Then, run docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
-	docker-compose.dev.yml inherits docker-compose.yml with additional possibility to build images locally and expose all containers ports for convenient development

##	Notes

-	All Spring Boot applications require already running Config Server for startup.
-	But we can start all containers simultaneously because of fail-fast Spring Boot property and restart: always docker-compose option
-	That means all dependent containers will try to restart until Config Server will be up and running
-	Also, Service Discovery mechanism needs some time after all applications startup
-	Any service is not available for discovery by clients until the instance, the Eureka server and the client all have the same metadata in their local cache, so it could take 3 hearbeats.
-	Default hearbeat period is 30 seconds

##	Architecture Evolution With Mulesoft

-	https://dzone.com/articles/architectures-evolution-with-mulesoft

###	Monolithic Architecture (Single Unit)

-	Monolithic architecture could be defined as the first architecture
-	they are executed in a single application layer and group all functionalities in the same one
![](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/10822035-slide1.jpg)
![](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/10822046-slide2.jpg)


##	SOA Architecture (Coarse-Grained)

-	Collection of services interacting with each other transferring some data or performing some operations
-	Mainly focused on business service reusability
-	Allows the connection between services and applications regardless of their technology or language in a fast and simple wa
![](https://dzone.com/storage/temp/10822050-slide3.jpg)

-	In this way, we eliminate all the work and most of the business logic to the application with monolithic architecture. 
-	The ESB will be in charge of transforming the data, routing, accessing the necessary services, managing errors, etc. 
-	The source application will simply generate a message (if necessary) and send it to the ESB via HTTP request


##	Microservice Architecture (Fine-Grained)

-	This architecture imitates SOA but with smaller and independent services.
- 	Microservices bring a lot of complexity to the architectural level as there are many small actors involved, but the advantage is that they are all isolated and independent
