#	Convention over configuration

-	Convention over configuration (also known as coding by convention) is a software design paradigm used by software frameworks 
-	Convention over Configuration  attempts to decrease the number of decisions that a developer using the framework is required to make without necessarily losing flexibility
-	The phrase essentially means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application
-	For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default.
-	It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table "product sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names
-	When the convention implemented by the tool matches the desired behavior, it behaves as expected without having to write configuration files
-	Only when the desired behavior deviates from the implemented convention is explicit configuration required.
