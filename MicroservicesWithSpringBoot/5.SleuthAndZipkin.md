#	Introduction to Distributed Tracing with zipkin

-	zipkin is a tool from spring cloud netflix used for distributed tracing
-	Zipkin is used to track the logs that went through chain of muliple microservices
-	netflix sleuth assigns unique id to the request that were going through multiple microservices
-	Zipkin provides a centralized platform for debugging logs that went through chain of microservices



##	Implementing Spring Cloud Sleuth

-	Just add sleuth dependency to the all the microservices and zuul api gateway


			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-sleuth</artifactId>
			</dependency>

	
-	Define Sampler bean that will add the unique id to the chain of requests

				
					@Bean
					public Sampler defaultSampler() {
						return Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE;
					}
					
					
					
					@SpringBootApplication
					@EnableFeignClients("com.in28minutes.microservices.currencyconversionservice")
					@EnableDiscoveryClient
					public class CurrencyConversionServiceApplication {

						public static void main(String[] args) {
							SpringApplication.run(CurrencyConversionServiceApplication.class, args);
						}

						@Bean
						public Sampler defaultSampler() {
							return Sampler.ALWAYS_SAMPLE;
						}

					}

##	Distributed Tracing with Zipkin

-	Zipkin provides a centralized platform for debugging logs that went through chain of microservices
-	Centralized logging can be done using ELK and kafka
-	Zipkin also provides same platform for Centralized log tracing
-	Chain of microservices will push the logs Rabbit MQ which will be pulled by Zipkin and can be tracked using Zipkin Dashboard UI

-	Create a Spring Boot application
-	Add Dependencies 
	
		-	Devtools
		-	Actuator
		-	Config client
		-	Eureka Discovery
		-	sleuth 
		-	zipkin
		-	amqp
		
## Install Rabbit MQ

## Install Zipkin

-	Zipkin stream server has issue with spring boot version
-	So we need to install Zipkin manually either using Java or Docker
	
	
			java -jar zipkin-server-5.2-exec.jar
			
-	This will launch the zipkin tracing server and tracing UI at : http://localhost:9411/zipkin/



## Connect Rabbit MQ with Zipkin server

-	We need to connect Rabbit MQ with Zipkin server for pulling messages from MQ
-	Command to connect MQ with Zipkin server

		
			RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost java -jar zipkin-server-5.2-exec.jar


##	Connecting microservices to Zipkin

-	Add zipkin dependency to all the microservices
-	Add amqp dependency to connect to Rabbit MQ
