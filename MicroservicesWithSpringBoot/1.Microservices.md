#	Micro-services with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud


## What is Microservices

-	Collection of small autonomous services that work together built around business model
-	These service are independently deployable by fully automated deployment


## 	What is Spring Cloud

-	Spring Cloud provides tools to quickly build common patterns in distributed systems
-	Eg : configuration management, service discorvey, circuit breakers, request routing, control business
-	There are wide variety of projects under spring cloud like 
	-	spring cloud netflix (Eureka, Hystrix, Zuul, Ribbon, Zipkin)
	-	spring cloud bus (Spring Cloud Bus, amqp)
	-	spring cloud for cloud foundry

## What is Cloud Enabled

-	Cloud Enabled means we can enable multiple instances of microservice with in a matter of seconds
-	Can scale up or scale down based on load with in a matter of seconds


##	 Challenges with Microservices

-	Bounded Context

	-	Establishing right boundaries for the application
	-	Its difficult to establish a boundaries for new application
	-	Deciding boundaries for microservice is a evolutionary process

	
-	Configuration Management

	-	Lets assume we have 6 six microservice and each having 4 instances
	-	Configuration management of these many instances would become very difficult
	
-	Dynamic Scale up and Scale down

	-	Loads should be equally distributed around the available instances 
	
-	Fault Tolerant (Pack of Cards)
	- 	fallback methods or virtualization technology
	-	if not well designed microservice can be pack of cards
	
	
-	Visibility and Monitoring
	-	metrics and latency

##	Spring Cloud Components and Solutions for Microservices Architecture	

-	Configuration Management
	-	Spring Cloud Config Server
	
-	Dynamic Scale up and Scale down	
	-	Netflix Feign (Easier REST Clients)
	-	Netflix Ribbon (Client Side Load Balancing)
	-	Netflix Naming Server (Eureka)
		
-	Visibity and Monitoring
	-	Netflix Zuul API Gateway
	-	Netflix Zipkin Distributed Tracing

-	Fault Tolerance and circuit breaking using Hystrix and Turbine


------------------------------------------------------
## Configuration with Spring Cloud Config server

-	We can manage all the configuration for all the instances of microservices by placing in single centralized location
-	Place all the files in git repository
-	Spring Cloud config server can be used to expose all the configuration of instances of microservices

##	Dynamic Scale up and down

-	Naming server (Eureka)
-	Ribbon (Client Side Load Balancing)
-	Feign (Easier REST Clients)


##	Visibity and Monitoring

-	Zipkin tracing server and ELK
-	Netflix API gateway


##	Fault Tolerance

-	Hystrix and Turbine
-	Using Hystrix we can add a fallback method to break the circuit 
-	Hystrix also generates the metrics and latency of request and pushes them to turbine which we can use for monitoring the application


--------------------------------------------------------

##	Advantages of Microservices Architectures

-	Isolation Developments
-	Adaptability to new Technologies
-	Faster Release Cycles with Continuous Integration and Deployment
-	Great Monitoring Tools
-	Dynamic Scaling
	
	-	According to load 
	-	Holiday season and Shopping days
