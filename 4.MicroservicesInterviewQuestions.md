-	Spring Boot actuator provides restful web services to access the current state of running an application in the production environment



##	How Do You Override a Spring Boot Project’s Default Properties?

-	This can be done by specifying the properties in the application.properties file


##	Role of Actuator in Spring Boot?

-	Monitor the spring boot application
-	Provides multiple metrics details which can be used to check the current state.
- 	They also provide endpoints for RESTful web services which can be simply used to check the different metrics.

##	How Is Spring Security Implemented In a Spring Boot Application?

-	Add spring-security related jars
-	Create a spring security config class by extending WebSecurityConfigurer interface

##	Which Embedded Containers Are Supported by Spring Boot?

-	Jetty ,Tomcat, undertow


##	 What Do You Mean by End-To-End Testing of Microservices?

-	End-to-end testing validates all the processes in the workflow to check if everything is working as expected		
-	It also ensures that the system works in a unified manner, thereby satisfying the business requirement
-	This ensures that the system works together as a whole and satisfies all requirements.



##	How Can You Set Up Service Discovery?

-	Using Eureka naming server


##	Why Would You Opt for Microservices Architecture?

-	Can be deployed independently and in relatively less time.
-	Continuous Integration and Deployment
-	Microservices can adapt easily to other frameworks or technologies.


##	Why Would You Need Reports and Dashboards in Microservices?

-	Reports and dashboards are mainly used to monitor and upkeep microservices. There are multiple tools that help to serve this purpose
-	Find out which microservices expose what resources.
-	Find out the services which are impacted whenever changes in a component occur.


##	Why Do People Hesitate to Use Microservices?

-	They require heavy investment 
-	They need heavy architecture set up 
-	They need excessive planning for handling operations overhead 
-	They have autonomous staff selection – Skilled professionals are needed who can support microservices that are distributed heterogeneously.


##	Define Domain Driven Design


-	DDD focuses mostly on domain logic and the domain itself.
-	Complex designs are completely based on the domain’s model.
-	To improve the design of the model and fix any emerging issues, DDD constantly works in collaboration with domain experts.


##	List down the advantages of Microservices Architecture.

-	Independent Development	 
-	Independent Deployment
-	Isolated Environment
-	High Availability

##	What are the pros and cons of Microservice Architecture?


##	 What is the difference between Monolithic, SOA and Microservices Architecture?
-	Monolithic Architecture is similar to a big container wherein all the software components of an application are assembled together and tightly packaged
-	A Service-Oriented Architecture is a collection of services which communicate with each other.
	- 	The communication can involve either simple data passing or it could involve two or more services coordinating some activity
-	Microservice Architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services, modeled around a business domain.



##	 What are the key differences between SOA and Microservices Architecture?

SOA	| MSA
----|-----
Follows “share-as-much-as-possible” architecture approach |	Follows “share-as-little-as-possible” architecture approach
Importance is on business functionality reuse	| Importance is on the concept of “bounded context”
They have common governance and standards	| They focus on people, collaboration and freedom of other options
Uses Enterprise Service bus (ESB) for communication	| Simple messaging system
They support multiple message protocols	| They use lightweight protocols such as HTTP/REST etc.
Multi-threaded with more overheads to handle I/O	| Single-threaded usually with the use of Event Loop features for non-locking I/O handling
Maximizes application service reusability	| Focuses on decoupling
Traditional Relational Databases are more often used	| Modern Relational Databases are more often used
A systematic change requires modifying the monolith | 	A systematic change is to create a new service
DevOps / Continuous Delivery is becoming popular, but not yet mainstream	| Strong focus on DevOps / Continuous Delivery


##	What is Domain Driven Design?

-	Focuses on Domain Logic
-	Finds complex designs on models of the domain


##	What is Cohesion?

-	The degree to which the elements inside a module belong together is said to be cohesion.


##	What is Coupling?

-	The measure of the strength of the dependencies between components is said to be coupling.
-	A good design is always said to have High Cohesion and Low Coupling.


##	What is REST/RESTful and what are its uses?

-	Representational State Transfer (REST)/RESTful web services are an architectural style to help computer systems communicate over the internet
-	This makes microservices easier to understand and implement.
-	Microservices can be implemented with or without RESTful APIs, but it’s always easier to build loosely coupled microservices using RESTful APIs.


##	What is the use of WebMvcTest annotation in Spring MVC applications?

-	WebMvcTest annotation is used for unit testing Spring MVC Applications in cases where the test objective is to just focus on Spring MVC Components


##	 Can you give a gist about Rest and Microservices?

-	REST
	-	REST is also used in other applications such as web apps, API design, and MVC applications to serve business data
	-	Though you can implement microservices in multiple ways, REST over HTTP is a way to implement Microservice
	
-	Microservices

	-	Microservices is an architecture wherein all the components of the system are put into individual components, which can be built, deployed, and scaled individually


-	In a nutshell, you can say that REST is a medium to build Microservices.


##	What do you understand by Distributed Transaction?

-	Distributed Transaction is any situation where a single event results in the mutation of two or more separate sources of data which cannot be committed atomically
- 	In the world of microservices, it becomes even more complex as each service is a unit of work and most of the time multiple services have to work together to make a business successful


##	What is an Idempotence and where it is used?

-	Idempotence is the property of being able to do something twice in such a way that the end result will remain the same i.e. as if it had been done once only.
-	Usage: Idempotence is used at the remote service, or data source so that, when it receives the instruction more than once, it only processes the instruction once.
	
##	What is OAuth?

-	OAuth stands for open authorization protocol
-	This allows accessing the resources of the resource owner by enabling the client applications on HTTP services such as third-party providers Facebook, GitHub, etc
- 	So with this, you can share resources stored on one site with another site without using their credentials


##	What is the use of Container in Microservices?

-	Containers provides good way to develop and deploy the microservices based applications
-	Easy to manage and scale the microservices applications
-	Web	can encapsulate our microservice in a container image along with its dependencies
-	which then can be used to roll on-demand instances of microservice without any additional efforts required


		

##	What do you understand by Semantic monitoring in Microservices architecture?

-	Semantic monitoring, also known as synthetic monitoring combines automated tests with monitoring the application in order to detect business failing factors.

##	What is the difference between Mock or Stub?

-	Stub

	-	A dummy object that helps in running the test.
	-	Provides fixed behavior under certain conditions which can be hard-coded.
	-	Any other behavior of the stub is never tested.
	
	-	For example, for an empty stack, you can create a stub that just returns true for empty() method. So, this does not care whether there is an element in the stack or not.


-	Mock

	-	A dummy object in which certain properties are set initially
	-	The behavior of this object depends on the set properties
	-	The object’s behavior can also be tested
	
	-	For example, for a Customer object, you can mock it by setting name and age.
	-	You can set age as 12 and then test for isAdult() method that will return true for age greater than 18
	-	So, your Mock Customer object works for the specified condition
	
	
##	What is the purpose of Docker?

-	Docker provides a container environment that can be used to host any application
-	In this, the software application and the dependencies which support it are tightly-packaged together
-	Continuous Integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control.


##	What is Continuous Monitoring?

-	Continuous monitoring gets into the depth of monitoring coverage, from in-browser front-end performance metrics, through application performance, and down to host virtualized infrastructure metrics.

##	Spring Cloud annotations and configuration?

-	@EnableEurekaServer annotation allows us to register microservices to the spring cloud.
-	@EnableDiscoveryClient annotation also allows us to query Discovery server to find miroservices.


##	What Netflix projects did we use?

-	Eureka created by Netflix, it is the Netflix Service Discovery Server and Client. 
-	Netflix Ribbon, it provide several algorithm for Client-Side Load Balancing. Spring provide smart RestTemplate for service discovery and load balancing by using @LoadBalanced annotation with RestTemplate instance.


##	How do you setup Service Discovery?

-	Spring Cloud support several ways to implement service discovery but for this I am going to use Eureka created by Netflix
-	Spring Cloud provide several annotation to make it use easy and hiding lots of complexity

##	How do you access a RESTful microservice?

-	RestTemplate, ribbon, feign clients


##	What is Eureka?

-	Eureka is the Netflix Service Discovery Server and Client. Eureka Server is using Spring Cloud.


##	How to Configure Spring Boot Application Logging?


-	Spring Boot comes with added support for Log4J2, Java Util Logging, and Logback
-	It is usually pre-configured as console output
-	They can be configured by only specifying logging.level in the application.properties file.
			
			logging.level.spring.framework=Debug


##	What Do You Mean By Bounded Context?

-	A central pattern usually seen in domain driven design
-	Bounded Context is the main focus of the strategic design section of DDD
-	It is all about a deal with large teams and models
-	DDD works with large models by disintegrating them into multiple bounded context.
-	While it does that, it also explains the relationship between them explicitly
